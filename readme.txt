Dillon McHenry and Dave Lazauskas: GUItar Hero Project 3.1


Project Summary:

GUItar Hero is a rhythm game that allows users to choose a song, and press keys to correctly hit notes
coming down a track.


What is done for our prototype:

- Pagelayout
- User can choose a song
- Song information is displayed in bottom left
- Key bindings can be changed
- The audio of the song will play when the play button is pressed
- Notes are drawn with song (not in time)

What still needs to be done

- Drawing of notes in time with the song
- Listeners to decide if a user has correctly timed a key hit
- Score calculator
